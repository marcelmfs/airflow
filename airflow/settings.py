    This policy setting allows altering task instances right before they
    are executed. It allows administrator to rewire some task parameters.

    Note that the ``TaskInstance`` object has an attribute ``task`` pointing
    to its related task object, that in turns has a reference to the DAG
    object. So you can use the attributes of all of these to define your
    policy.

    To define policy, add a ``airflow_local_settings`` module
    to your PYTHONPATH that defines this ``policy`` function. It receives
    a ``TaskInstance`` object and can alter it where needed.

    Here are a few examples of how this can be useful:

    * You could enforce a specific queue (say the ``spark`` queue)
        for tasks using the ``SparkOperator`` to make sure that these
        task instances get wired to the right workers
    * You could force all task instances running on an
        ``execution_date`` older than a week old to run in a ``backfill``
        pool.
